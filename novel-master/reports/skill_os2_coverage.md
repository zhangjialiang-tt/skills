## Reference Extension Tracks

| Track | Status | Current | Target | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Skill Interpretation Report | `partial` | Skill Overview v2 already covers much of the explainer experience, but dedicated skill-interpretation JSON/HTML artifacts are not first-class yet. | Either keep skill-overview as the canonical interpretation report with an explicit contract, or split a dedicated reports/skill-interpretation.* renderer and tests. | Decide whether overview v2 is the canonical interpretation surface; if not, add a dedicated schema, renderer, and CJK/path-safety tests. |
| Adaptive Self-Iteration | `planned` | The repo has feedback, iteration, telemetry, and review artifacts, but no adapt-scan/adapt-propose/adapt-apply approval loop and no user-memory policy. | Proposal-only adaptation with explicit input source, redaction, allowlisted write targets, approval ledger, regression report, and rollback plan. | Start with policy and read-only scan tests; do not read shell history or private logs unless the user provides an explicit source path. |
| Daily SkillOps Report | `partial` | Adaptive scan/propose exists, but the daily operations report is not fully wired into scripts, tests, and evidence artifacts. | Generate reports/skillops/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.* from explicit sources without private log scanning, source writes, auto-patching, or world-class overclaiming. | Keep Daily SkillOps report aligned with proposal, approval, coverage, and world-class ledger contracts as the operations layer evolves. |
| Weekly Curator Report | `partial` | Daily SkillOps and Skill Atlas exist, but weekly curator aggregation is not fully wired into scripts, tests, and evidence artifacts. | Generate reports/skillops/weekly/YYYY-WNN.* without private log scanning, source writes, auto-patching, or world-class overclaiming. | Use weekly curator output as the Skill Librarian maintenance queue before approving any durable skill-library changes. |

These extension tracks come from the user-supplied 2.0 reference plan. They are tracked separately from the formal Skill OS blueprint so the report can distinguish landed local architecture from planned explainer/adaptor evolution.

## Next Highest-Leverage Moves

- Close the four world-class evidence ledger entries with accepted human or external evidence.
- Keep the first-class skill interpretation report and Skill Overview v2 contract synchronized as the report model evolves.
- Use Daily SkillOps with explicit curated sources to review adaptation proposals without scanning private logs or auto-patching.
- Keep the blueprint coverage report in CI so 2.0 plan drift is visible.
