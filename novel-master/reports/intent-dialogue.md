# Intent Dialogue

Skill: `novel-master`

## Opening Frame

Let's start from the real work, the result you care about, and the standards that matter here. We can make the structure clearer after that.

## Opening Tone Options

### 温柔陪伴型

- Best when: 用户想法还散、还在试探，或者需要先被接住。
- Example: 我们先不急着把它说成一个很完整的 skill。你就像跟我聊天一样，先说说你最想让它以后稳稳接住哪类重复工作；如果它做得很理想，最后应该交回你一个什么结果。

### 专业教练型

- Best when: 用户目标比较明确，希望被高效带着走。
- Example: 我们先把这件事讲清楚，再决定 skill 怎么设计。你先告诉我三件事：它要接住的重复任务是什么，别人通常会给它什么材料，最后你希望它交付什么结果。

### 共创伙伴型

- Best when: 用户已经有一些想法，希望一起打磨，不想被填表。
- Example: 我们把这次当成一次共创。你先给我一个粗糙版本就行，我先帮你看它真正的核心任务是什么，再一起决定边界、结构和接下来最值的一步。

## Conversation Path

1. Start with the user's own words, not package vocabulary.
2. Reflect the job, output, and non-goals back in one clean sentence.
3. Only then offer a tiny scaffold if it would help the user move faster.

## Why Start Here

Use this short dialogue before deep authoring. The goal is to learn the real job, output, exclusions, and constraints so the first package is small but accurate.

## Current Anchor

- Title: `novel-master`
- Description: 编排长篇网文项目的初始化、设定与人物/情节设计、章节规划与正文创作/续写/修订、文本评审、连续性维护、状态提交和恢复；负责意图识别、最小子 Skill 路由、权限风险与接受闸门，不直接替代子 Skill 生成内容。用户要求创建或持续维护网文项目、跨阶段协调或治理事实状态时使用；普通文本润色、第三方作品分析、阅读推荐、诗歌/一次性短篇灵感及非小说任务不使用。
- Focus: `trigger-and-output`
- Reference note: If you already have examples you admire, bring them in. We will learn the pattern, not copy the source.

## Questions To Ask

1. If this skill worked beautifully, what recurring job would it reliably handle for the user every time?
   Why: This reveals the real job-to-be-done and gives the package a humane center instead of a guessed prompt shape.
2. When someone reaches for this skill in the real world, what materials will they actually hand to it?
   Why: Input shape decides whether references, scripts, or templates are needed.
3. What finished output should it hand back so the user can immediately keep moving?
   Why: Outputs should drive the package structure before extra guidance is added.
4. Which nearby requests should this skill politely refuse so the boundary stays clean?
   Why: The exclusion list is the fastest route to better trigger quality.
5. What matters most here: speed, consistency, auditability, portability, governance, or tone/style fit?
   Why: Constraints decide how much structure, packaging, and review the skill actually needs.
6. Do you already have any references you want this skill to learn from, such as a repo, product, page, workflow, or prompt example?
   Why: A good reference can raise the quality bar quickly, but the skill should only borrow patterns and standards, never copy wording or confidential material.
7. What repeated manual step should become a deterministic asset first?
   Why: This usually reveals whether a script or reference should be created next.

## Capture Before Drafting

- Capability sentence: novel-master should turn a recurring request into a reliable reusable output without widening the boundary unnecessarily.
- Recommended first gate: `trigger and boundary`
- Tiny optional scaffold:
  - The repeated job it should reliably handle
  - The real inputs people will hand to it
  - The useful output it should hand back
  - What it should clearly refuse
- Capture: `recurring job`
- Capture: `real inputs`
- Capture: `required outputs`
- Capture: `exclusions`
- Capture: `constraints`
- Capture: `reference preferences`
- Capture: `first evaluation target`
